My current research topic is to analyze climate data, study and understand the climate impacts of cloud processes and finally represent them correctly using statistics and climate computer models.

Cloud has great impacts on our climate system. Cloud amount and optical depth play a significant role in changing the solar energy and water budget on the Earth surface so the surface temperature and precipitation greatly depends on cloud distribution. However, representing cloud is still a great challenge. Nowadays more and more statistical techniques and methods are introduced to describe cloud processes, especially the unresolved cloud subgrid characteristics. Recently, my advisor and I just finished a paper describing a cloud inhomogeneity relationship with model resolution and atmospheric instability based on realistic observed data. This scale-aware parameterization is able to adjust the microphysics inhomogeneity parameter automatically when climate model resolution needs to be changed. The math tools developed by statisticians and computer scientists can be introduced to benefit the climate modeling work.

My research interests focus on:

- Climate Model Evaluation and Diagnostics
- Scale-aware Cloud Representation in Climate Model
- Convection Parameterization in Climate Model

Besides climate modeling, I am also interested in data science field (see my [Data Science](/xxsite/datasci/) page). Statistical learning provides us another way of doing prediction when the target system is not well understood or too uncertain to build a physical model (think about stock market, pattern recognition, and so on). We may construct statistical model and feed it with lots of data and let it automaticaly learn the pattern inherent in the data. The limitation of statistical model is that we are usually lack of understanding how the internal system works but this can be also seen as an advantage, no need to look into it too deep. For a lot of applications, statistical learning model gives us very satisfactory results and that has already made our life much easier.
