Some math notation are explained first. The operator $P(S)$ means the probability of some set $S$ of sample space. Random variables are some real-value function of sample space. It would be much easier to specify the set we want for the probability  by using some condition of random variables. For example, $P(X=x)$ means the probabililty for the set when random variable $ X $ is taking the value $ x $.
